# ðŸš² Bike Store Data Analysis Using MYSQL
## Table of Contents
## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a bike store's operations using MYSQL. The project aims to uncover insights and trends and provide recommendations for improving store performance and customer satisfaction. The project includes advanced SQL concepts, such as Window Functions, Common Table Expressions(CTEs),etc. to enhance the depth and efficiency of the queries.

## Goals
- To analyze sales trends over time and identify patterns.
- To understand customer preferences and behaviour.
- To evaluate product and category performance.
- To assess staff performance and store contributions to revenue.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Query Platform**: MySQL Workbench
- **Data Source**: Public Dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database?select=orders.csv">Kaggle</a>
           - <a href="https://github.com/PallaviSharma04/Bike-Store-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project/tree/main/Bike%20Store%20Data">Bike Store </a>
- **Data Range** : Jan 2016 to Dec 2018

## Data Schema
The database consists of the following interconnected tables:
- **Customers**: Stores customer details and location information.
- **Orders**: Tracks order details such as status,date, and related store/staff information.

**Q1: Which months record the highest number of orders, and which store is responsible for the largest share of these orders?**
```sql
	WITH cte AS
		(
		SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS No_of_orders ,MONTHNAME(order_date) AS Month
		FROM orders
		GROUP BY Month
		ORDER BY No_of_orders DESC
		),
		cte2 AS
		(
		SELECT count(orders.order_id) No_of_orders, monthname(orders.order_date) Month, stores.store_name, 
		RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY monthname(orders.order_date) ORDER BY count(orders.order_id) DESC) AS rnk
		FROM orders JOIN stores
