## Data Analysis
**Q1: Which store contributes the most to the sales?** 
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE 
	rev_per_store AS (
	SELECT s.store_name,ROUND(SUM((oi.quantity*oi.list_price)*(1-oi.discount)),2) AS revenue
	FROM orders o JOIN stores s ON o.store_id=s.store_id
	JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id=oi.order_id
	GROUP BY s.store_name
	ORDER BY revenue DESC),
	sum_rev AS (SELECT sum(revenue) AS total
	FROM rev_per_store)
SELECT rev_per_store.*,concat(ROUND(100*rev_per_store.revenue/(sum_rev.total)),"%") as percentage_of_total
FROM rev_per_store JOIN sum_re
```
*Output*
