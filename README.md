## Table of Contents
## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a bike store's operations using MYSQL. The project aims to uncover insights and trends and provide recommendations for improving store performance and customer satisfaction. The project includes advanced SQL concepts, such as Window Functions, Common Table Expressions(CTEs),etc. to enhance the depth and efficiency of the queries.

## Goals
- To analyze sales trends over time and identify patterns.
- To understand customer preferences and behaviour.
- To evaluate product and category performance.
- To assess staff performance and store contributions to revenue.
